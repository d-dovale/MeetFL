# MeetFL

## Description

**MeetFL** is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between employers and job seekers. Built using Appery.io, this app facilitates connections within the job market by allowing users to search for and offer jobs efficiently.

### How It Works

- **Sign Up/Login**: Users can either sign up for a new account or log in if they already have one.
- **User Preferences**: During the first login, users select their preferred job sector and specify whether they are hiring or seeking employment.
- **Home Page**: Users see a list of registered members who are hiring or seeking jobs. A search function allows for filtering specific job types.
- **Interaction**: Users can contact potential employers or candidates via email directly from the app.
- **Navigation**: A bottom toolbar provides quick access to the Home, Settings, and Profile pages.

### Additional Features

- **Bug Reporting**: Users can report issues directly through a tool accessible from the home screen.
- **Social Sharing**: From the settings page, users can share the app or messages through various social media platforms.
- **Profile Customization**: The profile page allows users to update personal information and job preferences.

MeetFL is available for both iOS and Android platforms:

- **iOS Users**: Download directly from the App Store.
