MeetFL


Description and Instructions:
This project was made using Appery.io and is supposed to be used by employers and people looking for jobs to connect with eachother. When you first launch the app, you can login if you already have an account, or sign up if you don't. The first time you log in, you can choose a specific job you are interested in, and if you are looking to hire or be hired. When you sign up or sign in, you get taken straight to the home page , where you will see a list of people also registered in the app who are either looking for, or giving out jobs. The user can search for specific types of jobs they are interested in or are giving in the search bar at the top. For example, if you are looking for education related jobs, you can search for people who are giving that job, and get their email to cantact them. There is a bug reporting service in the home screen, in the top left, as well as a log out button on the top right. The bottom toolbar of the app shows buttons that can be pressed  and take you to the different parts of the app. There are 3 different pages: the home page, the settigns page, and the profile page. In the settings page, there is a button that allows the user to share our app, or write any message they want through most social medias. This directly connects you to your social media account and lets you send a message. There is also a terms of service and privacy policy button. The last button is a logout button that signs you out of your account. The profile screen lets the user change certain information, like their position.
